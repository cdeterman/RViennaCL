CRAN submission ViennaCL headers 1.7.0-0

I have read and agreed to the CRAN policies.  I note that
the package is larger than usually recommended, and explain
the reason for this, below.  In particular, it will ultimately
lead to saving space on CRAN and improving package efficiency.

Overview: This package aims to provide the ViennaCL headers 
for template use among CRAN packages.  This
offers a more efficient distribution system for CRAN because
replication of this code is avoided.

Benefits: 

(1) Immediately: the additional package gpuR heavily uses ViennaCL headers.
This allows for very rapid and efficient development of GPU enhanced functions
to greatly increase processing performance.  

(2) The future: Although gpuR provides many basic functionality, it is likely 
that developers may want additional C++ routines that use additional aspects of 
ViennaCL. I hope this will pay off down the road with increasing use of 
ViennaCL.

Thanks,

Charles
