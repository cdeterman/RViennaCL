Package: RViennaCL
Type: Package
Title: ViennaCL C++ Header Files
Version: 1.6.2-0

Description: ViennaCL provides free, portable C++ source
  libraries with a large part implemented as template headers.
  As done with the BH package, I have placed these libraries in
  this package as a more efficient distribution system for CRAN.
  The idea is that you can write a package that depends on the
  ViennaCL library and yet you do not need to distribute a copy 
  of this code with your package.
