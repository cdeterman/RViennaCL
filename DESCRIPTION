Description: 'ViennaCL' is a free open-source linear algebra library 
  for computations on many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC) and 
  multi-core CPUs. The library is written in C++ and supports 'CUDA', 
  'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP' (including switches at runtime). 
  I have placed these libraries in this package as a more efficient 
  distribution system for CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package 
  that depends on the 'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to 
  distribute a copy of this code with your package.
